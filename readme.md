# The website I have recently been working on

As a part of my learning process, I have recently been working on the website for a friend, who is a teacher of anti-discrimination's techniques. I am an author of the logo and its animation and of the entire website design.

## Web technologies: HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Without CMS.
